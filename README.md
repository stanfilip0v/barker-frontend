# Barker

Barker is a small, simple, Twitter-like social media. But instead of tweeting, people bark.

# How it works

### Guests

The guests can only view the home page where they can either login or register to the website

### Users

Every user can create barks, follow other users, view their profiles and see their barks.

On the homepage there is a feed with previews of all the barks of his followers and his own barks.

Users can also see a detailed view of the barks where they can like/dislike them, leave a comment or report them or if the bark belongs to them - delete it.

### Admins

An admin has all the functionality of a regular user plus a view of the Reports page, where all the reports left by users can be seen. If the admin
decides that the report is reasonable he can go to the bark and delete it, or if it isn't he can discard the report.
